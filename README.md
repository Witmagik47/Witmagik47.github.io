I created an animation that rotated a blue box 90 degrees clockwise and changed its color to red all at the same time.

I created an animation that changed the border radius of a red box to form a circle and also changed the color to green for a split second then back to red all at the same time.

## Hamburger Menu

I created an animation that made two out of the three lines on a hamburger menu, intersect to form an X. This animation only happens when the Hamburger Menu is clicked on.
